## My Work
- I’m currently helping code sex-based differences into a network-based ODE model of mycardial fibroblasts created by Dr. William Richardson and expanded by Jessie Rogers and Kelsey Watts
  - [Fibroblast Mechanotransduction Network](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62856)
- I have worked to perform a paramter analysis using the Palmetto Cluster to determine optimal values
  - [Palmetto Cluster Website](https://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/palmetto/about/)
- I have created a pipline to interface with Code created by Angela Ziegler and Dr. Jeffery Saucerman's lab which runs drug screens on a cardiac model
  - [FDA Drug Screen Paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/psp4.12599)
- I have saught to expand the list of drug targets in this screening by using Drugbank version 5.1.9
